_A simple portfolio template built by React JS. This is my first ever project. Feel free to use it as you wish._

# Features

- Very easy to change content
- No coding knowledge to use

### Guide to use

You don't need to dive in a complex JSX code to change anything. I stored all my image and text inside the src/data folder. You just simply find correct files and change contents you want.
For Avatar, you should use a square image and name it as Avatar.png.
